# Size-Invariant-Ship-detection-from-SAR-Images
A deep Learning project to detect ships from satellite images. 

Implementation of this repository has been kept confidential for the time being due to confidentiality aggrement but these are some of the outputs from the Experimentaion :

Sample_1 :
Confidence: Large Ship = 99%, Small Ship Moving = 35%  
Total Execution Time: 40.50ms  
Computation Resources used: 65.33 BFLOPS
